##### In a nutshell:

*   I'm a software engineer located in <a href="https://www.google.de/maps/place/Berlin">Berlin, Germany</a>.

*   I'm an architect and build things that work end-to-end, fit for purpose.

*   I'm a team builder and create structures that empower and let work flow.

*   I believe you can build great products only with your users in mind. I also know you have to say no a lot.

*   I remain to be a developer at heart and have worked with loads of programming languages in the past including but not limited to Java, JavaScript, SmallTalk, Prolog, Groovy, Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, NodeJS, and friends.

*   I like to lead and inspire through communication _and_ action; checkout some of my [recent talks](https://github.com/nikku/talks#readme) and [tools I've created](https://lefedt.de/projects/) to suplement them.

##### A little bit of history:

*   I spent a foreign semester at the [BTH](bth.se) in [Karlskrona, Sweden](http://maps.google.se/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=karlskrona&sll=61.606396,21.225586&sspn=28.283373,93.076172&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Karlskrona,+Blekinge&t=h&z=9) and received my masters in IT Systems Engineering from the [Hasso-Plattner-Institute](http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de), University of Potsdam in Potsdam, Germany.

*   I wrote [my master thesis]({{ relative('blog/posts/2012/master-thesis-finished/') }}) on reversible debugging (some sort of [back in time debugging](http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Lien08bBackInTimeDebugging.pdf)). It will make you never again regret missing a breakpoint. If you use Squeak/Smalltalk.

*   I've built up the [bpmn.io](https://bpmn.io/) project, providing best-in-class, extensible tooling for [viewing and editing BPMN](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) and related standards.

*   At the moment I work as a principal software engineer at [Camunda](http://www.camunda.com/), a company that helps process centric business to scale through [BPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management).

Most of the things I do are [open source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fHgx9mE5U). Check out [my GitHub page](https://github.com/nikku) or <a href="{{ relative('projects') }}">some of my projects</a>.
