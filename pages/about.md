##### In a nutshell:

*   I'm a software engineer located in <a href="https://www.google.de/maps/place/Berlin">Berlin, Germany</a>.

*   I'm a solution architect and work with diverse teams to build things that work end-to-end, fit for purpose.

*   I'm a team builder and create structures that empower and let work flow.

*   I worked with loads of programming languages in the past including but not limited to Java, JavaScript, SmallTalk, Prolog, Groovy, Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, NodeJS, and friends.

*   Apart from software development my additional fields of interest are software architectures, developer and user experience, software quality, and delivery. 

##### A little bit of history:

*   I spent a foreign semester at the [BTH](bth.se) in [Karlskrona, Sweden](http://maps.google.se/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=karlskrona&sll=61.606396,21.225586&sspn=28.283373,93.076172&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Karlskrona,+Blekinge&t=h&z=9) and received my masters in IT Systems Engineering from the [Hasso-Plattner-Institute](http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de), University of Potsdam in Potsdam, Germany.

*   I wrote [my master thesis]({{ relative('blog/posts/2012/master-thesis-finished/') }}) on reversible debugging (some sort of [back in time debugging](http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Lien08bBackInTimeDebugging.pdf)). It will make you never again regret missing a breakpoint. If you use Squeak/Smalltalk.

*   I've built up the [bpmn.io](https://bpmn.io/) project, providing best-in-class, extensible tooling for [viewing and editing BPMN](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) and related standards.

*   I work at [Camunda](http://www.camunda.com/), a company that helps process centric business to scale through [BPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management).
